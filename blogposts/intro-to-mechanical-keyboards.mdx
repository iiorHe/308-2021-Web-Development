**⌨️Keyboards!**\
What's so special about them? I mean, who in their right mind would spend *hundreds of dollars* on something as basic as a keyboard?

Well, I would. **I am that insane person**, and there are hundreds of thousands of like-minded peripheral psychos out there, so watch out. Better pray we don't catch you slippin' with your keyboard game.

In all seriousness, there is a good reason why someone might want to spend the extra cash to treat themselves to a quality keyboard.
A good way to look at keyboards is like buying shoes. If you don't spend much time outside, don't move around alot, you can get away with getting something basic. But if you jog alot, a subpar shoe will feel miserable. Same thing applies to computer peripherals. If you spend most of your time at the computer, and you find yourself typing alot, a mechanical *keeb*, might just be what you need to improve your experience with using a computer.
