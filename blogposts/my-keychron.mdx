What you're seeing here is my baby. My very first mechanical keyboard. 
Let me go over all the modifications I've done.

But first, a soundtest:
<div className="mr-auto ml-auto flex place-content-center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JT4Ew2zKf_4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>
So what have I done to it?
