# What kind of idiot would spend money on this?
Well, **me!**. I am that idiot. But the keyboard does wonders for my autistic brain so I consider it a worthwhile purchase.

Surprisingly enough, there is an actively growing mechanical keyboard
scene in Eastern Europe, despite the region being vastly economically
outpaces by the rest of the continent. You can easily get your
run-of-the-mill mechanical keyboard in most general electronic stores
albeit at a ludicrous price, and vastly inferior quality to even the
cheapest customs or prebuilts. That's just the market of mass-market
big-corp products from companies like Razer, SteelSeries and the likes.

# What can you do with them?
Lots! You can mod the crap out of them to make it entirely yours. Custom fit it for your preferred typing experience. Extend it's longevity in the future if you somehow manage to exhaust the 30-50 million actuation rated switches.
